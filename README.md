# Pay-Inequality-Data-Research
This research project aimed to investigate reasons why women are generally more disadvantaged in the workplace than men. 

The project is separated into 3 parts of comparison between genders: years of experience, job titles, and annual salary.

For each section, I identify the discrepancy in data, or the lack thereof, and explain its social causes and impact using peer-reviewed research.

The analysis of specific job titles' correlation with higher pay can be found at https://payyup.wordpress.com/job-title/. I used pandas and matplotlib to aggregate and filter the top 5 and top 20 highest earning words in a job title and their gender distribution.
